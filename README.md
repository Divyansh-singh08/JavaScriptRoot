# THIS IS THE INTERVIEW PREP..

# JavaScript: Function-scope vs. Block-scope, Variables, Data Types, typeof, Type Conversion, Equality, and Loop Labels

## 1. Function-scope vs. Block-scope

```js
// Scope:-
// Scope stands for where our variable will be available to use inside our code and where it will not.
function myFun() {
	var myName = "Company";
	console.log(myName);
}
myFun(); //output => "Company"

//Here inside myFun method, var has a function scope that's why it's not accessible outside the function.
/*Variable having Function-scope means variable will only be available to use 
inside the function it declared, will not be accessible outside of function, 
and will give Reference Error if we try to access.*/

console.log(myName); //output => ReferenceError

/*Block-scope:-
Block means a pair of curly brackets, a block can be anything that contains 
an opening and closing curly bracket.
Variable having Block-scope will only be available to use inside the block it declared, 
will not be accessible outside the block, and will give Reference Error if we try to access. */
if (true) {
	let myName = "block-scope";
	console.log(myName); //output=> "block-scope"
}
console.log(myName); //output => ReferenceError
```

## 1. Variables

```js
/* In JavaScript, there are 3 commonly used variable types: var, let, and const */
//Initializing a variable in JavaScript is a two-step process: declaration and initialization.
var dataName = "ProductBase"; // var has the function or global scope.
let information = "Delhi"; // let's have the block scope.
//const is utilized for defining variables with values that are intended to remain constant and unchangeable.
const PI = 3.14; // const variable has the block scope.
console.log(dataName, information, PI);
```

## 3. JavaScript Data Typesâ€‹â€‹

```js
// Primitive Types
/*
Number:    Represents both integer and floating-point numbers, e.g., 42, 3.14.
String:    Represents textual data, e.g., "Hello, world!".
Boolean:   Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value, e.g., let a;.
Null:      Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol:    A unique,function and immutable primitive value used as the key of an object property.
BigInt:    Represents numbers larger than 2^53 - 1, the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number type.
*/
let number = 12.45;
console.log(number);
let string = "this is String only";
console.log(string);
let Booleans = true;
console.log(Booleans);
let Undefined = undefined;
console.log(Undefined);
let Nulls = null;
console.log(Nulls);
let _Symbols = Symbol("I am testing 12ka4");
console.log(_Symbols);
```

## 4. Value = undefined

```js
/*When you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, JavaScript automatically assigns it the value undefined.
Here, address is declared but not initialized, so its value is undefined. 
If you attempt to use a variable that has been declared but not initialized, 
you will get undefined when trying to access its value
*/
let address;
console.log(address); // Outputs: undefined
```

## 5. How + and - Operators Handle Different Data Types in JavaScript

```js
let n1 = 5;
let n2 = "10";
// Output: 510 â†’ number + string = string, so it joins as "5" + "10"
// When using + with a number and a string,
// JavaScript converts the number to a string and joins them (concatenation).
console.log(n1 + n2); // output: 510

//But with -, JavaScript converts the string to a number and then does the math.
// So "10" becomes 10, and 5 - 10 = -5.
console.log(n1 - n2); //Output: -5 â†’ string is converted to number, then subtraction happens
```

## 6. typeof in JS

```js
// typeof is an operator in JavaScript used to check the data type of a value or variable.
console.log(typeof 10); // "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object"  // (this is a known bug in JS)
console.log(typeof { name: "JS" }); // "object"
console.log(typeof [1, 2, 3]); // "object"  // arrays are technically objects
console.log(typeof function () {}); // "function"
```

## 7 Type Conversion in JavaScript

```js
/* 
Implicit Conversion: Implicit type conversion in Javascript refers as when converting the values of one data type to another automatically.
Explicit Conversion
*/

// Implicit Conversion to String:-

/*Implicit type conversion in javascript to String refers to the automatic conversion of 
non-string values into string type when they are used in a context where a string is expected.*/
let result;
result = "5" + 2;
console.log(result); // "52"

/*Implicit Conversion to Number
JavaScript tries to convert non-numeric values to numbers to perform the operation.
*/
let answer;
answer = "3" * 2;
console.log(answer); // Output: 6
answer = "10" - "5";
console.log(answer); // Output: 5
answer = "100" / "10";
console.log(answer); // Output: 10
answer = "3" - "Hello";
console.log(answer); // Output: NaN (String "Hello" cannot be converted to a number)

//Non-numeric String Results to NaN
/*
In JavaScript, converting non-numeric strings to numbers using Number() results in NaN, 
indicating "Not-a-Number". For instance, Number("Hello"), Number("true"), or Number("") 
all yield NaN because these strings lack numeric value. For example:
 */
let result2 = Number("Hello") + 10;
console.log(result2); // Output: NaN
console.log(isNaN(result2)); // Output: true

/*
undefined used with number, boolean, or null
Utilizing undefined in numeric, boolean, or null operations yields NaN, indicating an undefined or un-representable value.
 */
let undefinedNum = undefined + 10;
console.log(undefinedNum); // Output: NaN

// JavaScript Explicit Conversion:
/* 
The conversion of one data type to another according to our need and using 
built-in methods is called as explicit type casting in javascript.
*/
// Convert to Number Explicitly
let stringValue = "42";
let numValue = Number(stringValue);
console.log(numValue); // Output: 42 (string converted to number)

//Convert to String Explicitly
let numValue2 = 42;
let stringValue2 = String(numValue2);
console.log(stringValue2); // Output: "42" (number converted to string)

//Convert to Boolean Explicitly
let value = 42; //"42" also work well
let boolValue = Boolean(value);
console.log(boolValue); // Output: true (number converted to boolean)
```

## 8. Difference Between == and === in Javascript return true/false

```js
// === strict check / == loosely check
var x = 2;
var y = "2";
//Equality coercion takes place when using â€˜ == â€˜ operator
console.log(x == y); // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
//Coercion does not take place when using the â€˜===â€™ operator.
console.log(x === y); // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"
```

## 9. Outer

```js
/*
Understanding Loop Labels in JavaScript (break and continue with Outer Loops)
In JavaScript, you can control nested loops using labels with break and continue.
This allows you to:
break completely out of an outer loop continue to the next iteration of an outer loop
*/
console.log("Example with break:");
// Example with break:
outerLoop: for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
	innerLoop: for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
		if (i === 2 && j === 2) {
			break outerLoop; // Breaks out of BOTH loops
		}
		console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
	}
}
/*
output:
i=1, j=1
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=3
i=2, j=1
*/
console.log("Another Example with continue:");
//Another Example with continue:
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	inner: for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
		if (j === 1) {
			continue outer; // Skips to next iteration of outer loop
		}
		console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
	}
}
/*
Output:-
i=0, j=0
i=1, j=0
i=2, j=0
*/
```

# JavaScript String

## 10. String Datatype

```js
// The string is a primitive data type in javascript.
// Strings in Javascript can be created by two methods
/* 
as primitives from string literals
as object using string() constructor
*/

//Creating strings as primitives:
const str1 = "String within double ticks";
const str2 = "String within single ticks";
const str3 = `String within backticks`;
console.log(str1, str2, str3);
// Note: The string created using backticks is known as template literal.

// Creating strings as an object
/*
Strings in javascript can be created by calling the String() constructor with the 
string as the parameter. The String() constructor is called using the new keyword and 
the value is assigned to a variable or constructor.
*/
const str4 = new String(
	"This string object is created by calling the constructor"
);
console.log(str4);
```

## 11. By using charAt() method

```js
//The charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single string of that index base
const str = "JavaScript is a Dynamic-based programming language";
console.log(str.charAt(0)); //output: J
console.log(str.charAt(4)); //output: S
```

## 12. By using Bracket Notation

```js
const str5 = "JavaScript is a JIT programming language";
console.log(str5[16]); //output: J
console.log(str5[5]); //output: c
```

## 13. String.fromCharCode()

```js
/*
String.fromCharCode()  is a static method that creates a string from 
a sequence of Unicode code points (UTF-16 code units). ASCI CODE
*/

// Single character
console.log(String.fromCharCode(65)); // "A"
console.log(String.fromCharCode(9731)); // "â˜ƒ" (snowman symbol)
// Character that requires surrogate pair (code point 0x1F600 for ðŸ˜€)
const smileyFace = String.fromCharCode(0xd83d, 0xde00);
console.log(smileyFace); // "ðŸ˜€"
// Basic Multilingual Plane characters (same as fromCharCode)
// Writing modern JavaScript (ES6+)
console.log(String.fromCodePoint(65)); // "A"
console.log(String.fromCodePoint(0x12ffff));
```

## 14. JavaScript String Methods

This section covers important JavaScript **String Methods** with their usage and examples.

---

## ðŸ“š Common String Methods Overview

```js
charAt()       => Finds the character present at a particular index in the string.
concat()       => Concatenates the string arguments.
indexOf()      => Returns the index of the first occurrence of the passed value.
lastIndexOf()  => Returns the index of the last occurrence of the passed value.
toLowerCase()  => Converts all the characters of the string into lowercase letters.
toUpperCase()  => Converts all the characters of the string into uppercase letters.
split()        => Divides the given string into an ordered list of substrings.
trim()         => Removes additional spaces around the string.
toString()     => Returns a string object as a string.
substring()    => Extracts the characters between two indices of a string and returns a substring.
slice()        => Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.

let string1 = "Javascript is a programming language";

// Find the character at index 2
console.log(string1.charAt(2)); // Output: v

// Concatenate additional string to the original
console.log(string1.concat(", ", "as well as one of the most used language."));
// Output: Javascript is a programming language, as well as one of the most used language.


// Get the first index of character 's'
console.log(string1.indexOf("s")); // Output: 4

// Get the last index of character 'a'
console.log(string1.lastIndexOf("a")); // Output: 33

// Convert the string to lowercase
let newStr1 = string1.toLowerCase();
console.log(newStr1);// Output: javascript is a programming language

// Convert the string to uppercase
let newStr2 = string1.toUpperCase();
console.log(newStr2);// Output: JAVASCRIPT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

// Split the string into an array by spaces
console.log(string1.split(" "));// Output: [ 'Javascript', 'is', 'a', 'programming', 'language' ]

// Split the string into only 2 parts
console.log(string1.split(" ", 2));// Output: [ 'Javascript', 'is' ]

// Remove extra whitespace from both ends
let str11 = " Javascript is a programming language   ";
console.log(str11.trim()); // Output: 'Javascript is a programming language'

// Convert String object to primitive string
let newStr = new String("Javascript");
console.log(newStr.toString());// Output: Javascript

// Extract substring starting from index 3
let str33 = "JavascriptD";
console.log(str33.substring(3)); // Output: ascriptD

// Extract substring between index 3 and 7
console.log(str33.substring(3, 7)); // Output: ascr

// Slice string from index 3 to end
let str44 = "Language_Check";
console.log(str44.slice(3)); // Output: guage_Check

// Slice string from index 4 to 9
console.log(str44.slice(4, 10)); // Output: uage_C

```

## 15 JS Imp topics

### What is Execution Context ?

```js
/* 
Execution Context:
It is said to be as JS refer to the  environment in which JS code execute
It consist of variable function object and other information that js tract and manage
It work on 2 phase:
--Creation phase
--code execution phase
*/
```

### What is Lexical Scope ?

```js
/*
What is scope? Scope refers to the visibility of variables, functions, and objects within some part of your code during runtime. 

Lexical Scope mean in programming i.e. in a nested group of functions, the inner functions 
will have access to the variables and the other resources of their parent scope.
*/
// Example of lexical scope:
/* 
And the inner function will have access to all the variables or methods defined inside it, or its parent. 
So, we can access the value of name & title both.
*/
function f1() {
	let name = "Programming";
	//_nestedF2() is lexical scope of --> f1()
	function _nestedF2() {
		let title = "Javascript";
		console.log("Hey I am from _nestedF2: ", name); // Programming
		console.log("Hey I am from _nestedF2: ", title); // Javascript
	}
	//call inside parent f1
	_nestedF2();
}
f1();

//Lexical scope of Example 2:
function A() {
	var m = 100; // local to A scope
	console.log(b, " b inside A "); // global b scope // 23
	C();
	function C() {
		console.log(b, " b inside C "); // global b scope // 23
		console.log(m, "m inside C "); // A scope m variable ---> lexical C scope // 100
	}
}
var b = 23; // global scope
A();
```

### What is Hosting in JS ?

```js
/*
It is a phenomena in JS by which we can access variable and function even before initialization,
and we don't get error[ we get undefine] 
*/
// Example of hosting
greet(); // hosting happen in function
console.log(culture); // Hosting happen in variable ---> give undefine
var culture = "workLifeBalance";
function greet() {
	console.log("Hello World off JS");
}

//Example 2
greet2("World");
function greet2(name) {
	console.log("Hello " + name); // Hello World
}
```

## What is Closures ?

```js
/*
Closure is a combination of a function bind together with it lexical Environment
            Function + Lexical Scope = Closure
*/
// Example of closure:
function closure() {
	var a = 7;
	function lexicalEnv() {
		console.log(a, " a is inside lexicalEnv fxn "); // lexical scope a of closure function
	}
	return lexicalEnv;
}

/* After lexicalEnv return now closure execution context is no longer present in callStack 
still remember the a .. this is closure  */
var data = closure(); // now data contain the LexicalEnv function details
console.log(data); // 7 a is inside lexicalEnv fxn
//..... let say lot of code then data() call it still remember the function + lexical env so that why it print it..
data(); // still remember a because of closure

//Closure Example 2:
function checkX() {
	var id = 12;
	function checkY() {
		// id is a reference to it not the value
		console.log(id, " id is the lexical of checkX ");
	}
	id = 1560;
	return checkY;
}

var zee = checkX();
console.log(zee);
zee(); //OP -> 1560 id is the lexical of checkX // still remember the function + it's lexical Env

// Closure Example 3:
/* 
here closure is form from 
Parent function --> to child Function --> to newChild function + lexical Env
remember to all it data function and variable
*/
function helloWorld() {
	var rollNo = 190;
	function computerClass() {
		var st = 7;
		function dsa() {
			console.log("rollNo: ", rollNo, " studentId: ", st); // Op => rollNo:  190  studentId:  71
		}
		st = 71;
		dsa();
	}
	computerClass();
}
helloWorld();

// Example 4 CLosure:-

//Due to Closure it will print 6 for 5 time..
function x() {
	// quick fix make it let i = 1 // bcz let is block scope will create
	// every loop a new variable of block scope
	for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
		setTimeout(function store() {
			console.log(i); // due to remember the reference of i
		}, i * 1000);
	}
	console.log("new data print");
}
// x();

//Closure Example 5:
// Without using let we solve above problem by using closure
function xee() {
	for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
		function close(i) {
			setTimeout(function () {
				console.log(i);
			}, i * 1000);
		}
		close(i);
	}
}
xee();
/* will print in the
1
2
3
4
5
*/
```

### JavaScript Closures - Explanation and Examples

```js
JavaScript that allow functions to "remember" their lexical scope even when executed outside that scope

Basic Closure Examples
//Example 1: Simple Closure
function outer() {
    var a = 100;
    function inner() {
        console.log("a is the lexical env of outer", a);
    }
    return inner;
}

var me = outer();
me(); // Output: "a is the lexical env of outer 100"
//Explanation: The inner function maintains access to the variable a from its parent scope even after outer has finished executing

//Example 2: Closure with let
function outer2() {
    let a = 20;
    function inner2() {
        console.log("a is of lexical Env of outer2", a);
    }
    return inner2;
}
var store = outer2();
store(); // Output: "a is of lexical Env of outer2 20"
//Explanation: Works the same as Example 1, demonstrating that closures work with let declarations
//just as they do with var.

//Example 3: Parameter in Closure
function outer3(b) {
    let a = 67;
    function inner3() {
        console.log(a, "RemFxLexEnv", b, "pass by value");
    }
    return inner3;
}
outer3("PassData")(); // Output: "67 RemFxLexEnv PassData pass by value"
// Explanation: The parameter b is also captured in the closure along with variable a,
// showing that function parameters are part of the lexical environment.

//Example 4: Nested Closures
function Exit() {
    var c = 20;
    function outer4(b) {
        function inner4() {
            console.log(a, "a", "b", b, "c", c);
        }
        let a = 10;
        return inner4;
    }
    return outer4;
}

var nestedOuter = Exit()(99);
nestedOuter(); // Output: "10 a b 99 c 20"
//Explanation: Demonstrates multiple levels of closure - inner4 has access to:
// Its own variables
// outer4's variables (a and b)
// Exit's variables (c)

//Example 5: Scope Chain in Closures
function Exit2() {
    var c = 30;
    function outer5(b) {
        function inner5() {
            console.log(a, b, c);
        }
        let a = 20;
        return inner5;
    }
    return outer5;
}
let a = 77;
var nesterOuter2 = Exit2()(0);
nesterOuter2(); // Output: "20 0 30"
//Explanation: Shows how JavaScript looks for variables in the scope chain.
// The local a in outer5 shadows the global a.
```

## Advantages of Closures

```js
/*
1 >Data Privacy / Encapsulation: Create private variables that can't be accessed from outside
2> Dynamic Function Creation: Create functions based on input parameters
3> Memoization: Cache expensive function calls for performance
4> Currying: Create partial function applications
*/
//	Data Hiding/Encapsulation
// 	Basic Counter Without Closure
var counter = 0;
function incrementCounter() {
	counter++;
}
//Problem: counter is accessible and modifiable from anywhere.

//Counter With Closure
function counter() {
	var count = 0;
	function incrementCounter1() {
		count++;
	}
	return incrementCounter1;
}
var myCounter = counter();
myCounter();
//Advantage: count is now private and can only be modified through the returned function.

//Enhanced Counter Example
function jCounter() {
	var count = 0;
	function incrementCounter2() {
		count++;
		console.log(count);
	}
	return incrementCounter2;
}

var storeCounter = jCounter();
storeCounter(); // Output: 1
storeCounter(); // Output: 2
//Explanation: This pattern allows creating multiple independent counters,
// each with their own private count variable.

//Multiple Independent Counters
var counter2 = jCounter();
counter2(); // Output: 1 (new counter starts from 0)
counter2(); // Output: 2

storeCounter(); // Output: 3 (original counter continues)
//Each call to jCounter() creates a new independent counter
//counter2 is completely separate from storeCounter

//Enhanced Counter with Methods
function CounterCheck() {
	var count = 0;
	this.increment = function () {
		count++;
		console.log(count, "counter increment");
	};
	this.decrement = function () {
		count--;
		console.log(count, "counter decrement");
	};
}
// new key word help to create constructor
// It like constructor function
// help of constructor we created invoked new counter
var count1 = new CounterCheck();
count1.increment(); // Output: "1 counter increment"
count1.increment(); // Output: "2 counter increment"
count1.decrement(); // Output: "1 counter decrement"
// Uses constructor function pattern for object creation
// Provides both increment and decrement methods
// Maintains private state (count) while exposing controlled interface
```

### Disadvantages of Closures in JavaScript

```js
/*
1. Memory Consumption
Issue: Closures maintain references to their outer function's variables, preventing garbage collection.
2. Performance Overhead
Issue: Accessing variables through closures is slightly slower than accessing local variables.
3. Unexpected Behavior
Issue: Closures capture variables by reference, not value, which can lead to unexpected results.
*/
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	setTimeout(function () {
		console.log(i); // Will print 3 three times!
	}, 100);
}
//Solution: Use let instead of var or create a new scope:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	// let creates block scope
	setTimeout(function () {
		console.log(i); // Prints 0, 1, 2 as expected
	}, 100);
}
/*
4. Debugging Complexity
Issue: Closures can make stack traces harder to read and debug.
5. Over-Encapsulation
Issue: Excessive use of closures can make code harder to understand and test.
*/
```

## Garbage Collection in JavaScript

```js
/*
Garbage collection (GC) is JavaScript's automatic memory management system that frees up memory by reclaiming space occupied by objects that are no longer needed by the program.

JavaScript uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm for garbage collection

1> Mark: The GC marks all objects that are still reachable from the root (global variables, currently executing functions, etc.)
2> Sweep: It then sweeps through memory and deallocates memory for unmarked objects
*/
// Example 1: Basic Garbage Collection
function createObject() {
	let obj = { data: "temporary" };
	// obj is eligible for GC after function completes
}
createObject();
// Explanation: The obj is automatically garbage collected after createObject() finishes because nothing references it anymore.
```

#### Example 2: Objects Kept Alive by References

```js
let globalObj;

function keepAlive() {
	let obj = { data: "important" };
	globalObj = obj; // Now referenced globally
}
keepAlive();
// Explanation: obj is NOT garbage collected because
// globalObj maintains a reference to it.

/* Key point to remember for GC:
	1> Objects are garbage collected when they become unreachable
	2> Closures, global variables, and forgotten references can prevent GC
	3> Modern browsers use efficient GC algorithms that minimize performance impact
	4> The best practice is to nullify references when you're done with large objects
*/
```

## Diving Deep into Function
```js
/*  
    1 What is Function statements ?
    2 What is Function Declaration ?
    3 What is Function Expression ?
*/
// 1&2 > Function statement and declaration is same things..
function Home() {
	console.log("Welcome to Home");
}
Home();// Welcome to Home

// 3 > Function Expression: act like a value
var Express = function () {
	console.log("act like value ");
};
Express();
```
### Major difference between them
```js
/* 
The major difference between above is in Hosting..
If we call  
Home() this will work
Express() but this will throw error Express is not define bcz of hosting
it treat as variable
which is undefine, bcz of not initialize at the same time, so u can't call undefine..
*/
```
## what is Anonymous Function ?
```js
/* 
Function without name is Anonymous function, it don't have there identity
function (){
}
what is the use case of this function if we can't create like above
Anonymous function are use in the place where function are used as a VALUE
*/
// 3 Name function Expression
var i = function xyz() {
	//xyz work inside the local env..
	console.log("i is check here ", xyz);
};
i();
// xyz();// this will give reference error bcz it created inside the local env or scope
```
### 4 Parameters & Arguments in JS ?
```js
/*When declaring a function, you specify the parameters. 
However, when calling a function, 
you pass the arguments corresponding to the parameters.
*/
// taking as parameters..
var jsLead = function (Parameters1, Parameters2) {
	console.log(Parameters1, Parameters2);
};
//passing arguments
jsLead("argument", 2); // argument 2
```
### 5 First-Class-Function && First-class-Citizens
```js
/*
   In JavaScript, functions are treated like any other variable. They can be:

*/
// 1. Assigning function to variable
const greet = function (name) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
console.log(greet("Alice")); // "Hello, Alice!"

// 2. Passing function as argument
function sayHi(greetingFn, name) {
	console.log(greetingFn(name));
}
sayHi(greet, "Bob"); // "Hello, Bob!"

// 3. Returning function from function
function createGreeter() {
	return function (name) {
		return `Hey there, ${name}!`;
	};
}
const casualGreet = createGreeter();
console.log(casualGreet("Charlie")); // "Hey there, Charlie!"
```

### 6. Callback Functions
```js
/*
Concept: Functions that are passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later 
(usually after some operation completes)
*/

// 1 >Simple callback example
function processUserInput(callback) {
	const name = prompt("Please enter your name");
	callback(name); // callback is refer to greetUser function
}
function greetUser(name) {
	console.log(`Welcome, ${name}!`);
}
processUserInput(greetUser); // Calls greetUser after getting input

//2> more example of callback
function cb(newCb) {
	console.log("cb called"); //1 cb called
	newCb();
}
cb(function newCb() {
	console.log("newCb called");//2 newCb called
});

/*
Callback function: JS is a synchronous and single-threaded language, which mean it perform
one task at a time in a specify manner,
But due to the callback we can do async task in JS which make JS Asynchronous....
*/

// Asynchronous callback example (common in JS)
setTimeout(function () {
	console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000); //3 This runs after 2 seconds
```
